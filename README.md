G.I.Haul, a Pittsburgh junk removal company, is franchising and needs separate micro-sites for each franchise location, starting with Tampa, Florida so the franchisee operators have a place to direct all their local web traffic & the ability to take book jobs in their market.

## Objectives:

- Measure engagement on the website
- Capture customer information
